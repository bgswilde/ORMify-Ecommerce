  ## Installation
  Use the command 'git clone' in your command line with the link of this repo while navigated to your desired directory to copy this repo to your machine, run 'npm install' or 'npm i' in your command line in the root folder of this application to install dependencies required (mysql2, sequelize, express, dotenv). (note: it is not recommended to update the version of these dependencies, in order to ensure maximum compatability)

  ## Usage
  1. To use your own mysql database with this program, make sure you create a .env file and include your mysql database usage and credentials. 
  2. In your command line while in the root folder of the application, login to the mysql shell using the command 'mysql -u root -p'. If you are using a different mysql user specify that in place of root. You'll insert your password after executing this command.
  3. Run the command 'SOURCE db/schema.sql' to start with a fresh database. 
  4. Exit the mysql shell using 'quit;' 
  5. While still in the application root folder, run the command 'npm run seed' to seed your database with table data from the application.
  6. Run the command 'npm start' to initialize the server.
  7. Using insomnia, or some other visual server API route GUI, you can run any of the routes listed in the route folders using the corresponding api address beginning with http://localhost:3001/api/
